    "PySpecKit is a python toolkit designed for the analysis and interpretation of spectroscopic data across optical, infared, and radio wavelengths. Its primary goal is to provide a general purpose framework for spectroscopic line analysis that is compatible with a wide range of data formats. PySpecKit enables line fitting procedures like Gaussian and Voigt profile fitting as well as baseline subtraction and interactive data visualization. It also offers tools for producing publication-quality plots with LaTeX rendered axis labels. PySpecKit was originally developed for astrophysics applications, but its flexible design makes it useful for fields such as materials science where it can be used to fit photoluminescence or  absorbance spectra to extract physical properties like the optical bandgap for semiconductor materials."

Its development was influenced by the need to automate and improve spectral line fitting in large radioastronomy datasets. Some related codes are specutils, pysynphot, and astropy's modeling framwork, which PySpecKit uses internally."
